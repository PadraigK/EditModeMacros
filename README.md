# Edit Mode Switch

A simple Blender add-on that provides keyboard shortcuts for quickly switching between Object mode and Edit mode with automatic selection mode switching.

## What it does

This add-on adds four keyboard shortcuts that speed up your modeling workflow:

- **1**: Switch from Object mode to Edit mode with **Vertex** selection
- **2**: Switch from Object mode to Edit mode with **Edge** selection  
- **3**: Switch from Object mode to Edit mode with **Face** selection
- **4**: Switch from Edit mode back to **Object** mode

## Installation

2. In Blender, go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk**

## Important: Disable conflicting shortcuts

You need to disable the existing Object shortcuts for 1,2,3,4

1. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Keymap**
2. Search for "1" and disable any existing shortcuts that use the 1 key
3. Repeat for keys 2, 3, and 4
